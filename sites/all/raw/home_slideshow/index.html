					<h2></h2>
					<p>Students want universities to help them learn skills.</p>
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
					<p class="right">Universities let them down.</p>
				</section>

				<section data-state="arrowpointeroff">
					<h2></h2>
					<p>Programming, writing, data analysis... People with skills can 
            make a good living.</p>
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
					<p>Universities promise to help people learn skills that will
            get them a good job.</p>
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Students give universities money and time. Lots of both.</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2></h2>
					<p>Universities often fail students. Poorly designed courses. 
            Ill-prepared faculty. An indifferent system.</p>
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
					<p>Grads in debt, without the skills they need.</p>
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
					<p>Employers can't fill well-paying jobs.</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>It doesn't have to be this way.</h2>
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>We <em>know</em> how to help people learn skills. 
            Existing research shows us how.</p>
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
					<p>But universities don't use the research. 
            Professors don't study it. They are doing research. 
            Publish or perish.</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2></h2>
					<p>Will universities rewire themselves to keep their promises 
            to students?</p>
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
					<p>No. Not soon, perhaps not ever. Current practices are too 
            entrenched.</p>
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
					<p>But there are cracks in the system.</p>
				</section>

				<section class='smaller-text'>
					<h2>Cracks in the system</h2>
					<p>Most professors say they like interacting with students.</p>
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
					<p>Professors like using their skills. Math professors like 
            doing math.</p>
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
					<p>Professors or committees choose textbooks. They can choose 
            good ones, as well as bad.</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>More cracks in the system</h2>
          <p>In every field, there <em>are</em> professors who care about 
            student learning. They will put in the effort to learn
            about learning.</p>
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
					<p>It doesn't take a Ph.D. to grade intro programming exercises. 
            There are people around the globe who can do it.</p>
				</section>

				<section class='smaller-text'>
					<h2>CyberCourse</h2>
					<p>CyberCourse (Cyco for short) is a philosophy, set of techniques, 
            and open source software.</p>
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Cyco works through the cracks. It can improve 
            courses <em>now</em>, without 
            waiting for universities to fix themselves.</p>
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
					<p>It starts with authors...</p>
				</section>

				<section class='smaller-text'>
					<h2>Authors</h2>
					<p>Authors are experts in chemistry, analytics, writing, etc. 
            Plus, they want to help students learn.</p>
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
					<p>The Cyco community helps authors learn about learning. 
            The basics, like outcome-based courses, deep learning, 
            metacognition, and formative feedback.</p>
				</section>

				<section class='smaller-text'>
					<h2></h2>
					<p>Authors create CyberCourses. They're like interactive textbooks, 
            but written to higher learning standards than 
            traditional textbooks.
            Less text, more exercises, more feedback.</p>
					<p>The open source Cyco software helps authors create good courses. 
            Course design tools to visually map relationships between skills, 
            prerequisite knowledge, and learning experiences. 
            Exercise creation tools that help make grading rubrics. 
            And many others.</p>
				</section>

				<section class='smaller-text'>
					<h2></h2>
					<p>Authors can sell access to their Cycos, if they want. 
            Authors don't get 10% or 15% royalties. They get 
            <em>100%</em> of the revenue.</p>
					<p>Authors can do good work, set low prices, and still 
            pay the mortgage.</p>
					<p>Authors can serve small markets. For example, an algebra 
            course for Spanish-speaking students in south Florida. With 
            local landmarks and local issues. When the Miami Marlins play, 
            game stats could be in the course the next day.</p>
				</section>

				<section class='smaller-text'>
					<h2></h2>
					<p>Typical CyberCourses are flipped, blended, with lots of 
            assessment.</p>
					<p>No lectures. If the course content is good enough, 
            there's no need.</p>
					<p>Many exercises, perhaps three times as many as 
            traditional courses.</p>
					<p>Class time is for helping students with exercises, or 
            giving new exercises. Students get one-on-one help, with their 
            own specific issues.</p>
				</section>

				<section class='smaller-text'>
					<h2></h2>
					<p>Exercises are embedded throughout the course. Students 
            write programs, analyse data sets, design circuits.</p>
					<p>Students submit their work online. They get feedback from a 
            human. Not just a score, but a list of things they did right 
            and wrong. Ideally, they get a chance to improve their work, 
            and submit again.</p>
					<p>They get human feedback for *every* exercise. Yes, this is 
            economically feasible. More later.</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2></h2>
					<p>Students work through courses at their own pace, or at a 
            pace set by the instructor.</p>
					<p>Students who fall behind are reminded of where they should be.</p>
