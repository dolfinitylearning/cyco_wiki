					<h2></h2>
					<p>Students want universities to help them learn skills.</p>
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
					<p class="right">Universities let them down.</p>
				</section>

				<section data-state="arrowpointeroff">
					<h2></h2>
					<p>Programming, writing, data analysis... People with skills can 
            make a good living.</p>
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
					<p>Universities promise to help people learn skills that will
            get them a good job.</p>
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Students give universities money and time. Lots of both.</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2></h2>
					<p>Universities often fail students. Poorly designed courses. 
            Ill-prepared faculty. An indifferent system.</p>
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
					<p>Grads in debt, without the skills they need.</p>
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
					<p>Employers can't fill well-paying jobs.</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>It doesn't have to be this way</h2>
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>We <em>know</em> how to help people learn skills. 
            Existing research shows us how.</p>
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
					<p>But universities don't use the research. 
            Professors don't study it. They do research. 
            Publish or perish.</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2></h2>
					<p>Will universities rewire themselves to keep their promises 
            to students?</p>
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
					<p>No. Not soon. Current practices are too 
            entrenched.</p>
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
					<p>But there are cracks in the system.</p>
				</section>

				<section class='smaller-text'>
					<h2>Cracks in the system</h2>
					<p>Most professors say they like interacting with students.</p>
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
					<p>Professors like using their skills. Math professors like 
            doing math.</p>
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
					<p>Professors or committees choose textbooks. They can choose 
            good ones, as well as bad.</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>More cracks in the system</h2>
          <p>In every field, there <em>are</em> professors who care about 
            student learning. They will put in the effort to learn
            about learning.</p>
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
					<p>It doesn't take a Ph.D. to grade intro programming exercises. 
            There are people around the globe who can do it.</p>
				</section>

				<section class='smaller-text'>
					<h2>CyberCourse</h2>
					<p>CyberCourse (Cyco for short) is a philosophy, set of techniques, 
            and open source software.</p>
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Cyco works through the cracks. It can improve 
            courses <em>now</em>, without 
            waiting for universities to fix themselves.</p>
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
					<p>It starts with authors...</p>
				</section>

				<section class='smaller-text'>
					<h2>Authors</h2>
					<p>Authors are experts in chemistry, analytics, writing, etc. 
            They want to help students learn, but may not know how.</p>
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
					<p>The Cyco community helps authors learn about learning. 
            The basics, like outcome-based courses, deep learning, 
            metacognition, and formative feedback.</p>
				</section>

				<section class='smaller-text'>
					<h2>Authors</h2>
					<p>Authors create CyberCourses. They're like online textbooks, 
            but written to higher quality standards than 
            traditional textbooks.</p>
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
					<p>"Quality" means students learn skills. </p>
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>We <em>already know</em> how to help students. 
            Less reading, more exercises, more feedback. </p>
				</section>

				<section class='smaller-text'>
					<h2>Authors</h2>
          <p>Open source Cyco software helps authors create
            effective courses.</p>
          <p>Course design tools link skills, 
            knowledge, and activities
            (outcome-driven course design).</p> 
          <p>Grading tools with "clickable rubrics"
            permit large-scale human grading
            (formative feeback).</p>
          <p>Pseudostudents model good learning (metacognition).</p>
           <p>And much more.</p>
				</section>

				<section class='smaller-text'>
					<h2>Self-sustaining</h2>
          <p>One Cyco can serve thousands of students.</p>
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
					<p>Authors can sell access to their Cycos. 
            They don't get 15% royalties. They get 
            <em>100%</em> of the revenue.</p>
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
					<p>Authors can do good work, set low prices, and still 
            pay the mortgage.</p>
				</section>

				<section class='smaller-text'>
					<h2>Courses matching students' needs</h2>
					<p>Authors can serve small markets with courses that
            are relevant to students' lives.</p> 
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>For example, an algebra 
            course for Spanish-speaking students in south Florida. With 
            local landmarks and local issues. When the Miami Marlins play, 
            game stats are in the course the next day.</p>
				</section>

				<section class='smaller-text'>
					<h2>Running CyberCourses</h2>
					<p>Flipped, blended, heavy on the 
            assessment.</p>
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
					<p>No lectures. With good content, there's no need.</p>
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
					<p>Many exercises, perhaps three times as many as 
            traditional courses.</p>
				</section>

				<section class='smaller-text'>
					<h2>What happens in class?</h2>
          <p>Professors work with students one-on-one, or in small groups.</p>
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
					<p>Help students do tasks. Write programs, balance equations,
            analyze data...</p>
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Explain concepts students don't understand.</p>
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Many profs prefer this to lecturing.</p>
				</section>

				<section class='smaller-text'>
					<h2>Exercises</h2>
					<p>Students do tasks, like analyze a data set.</p>
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
					<p>Students submit their work online. They get feedback from a 
            human. Maybe not the professor, but someone with 
            enough expertise.</p>
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Students get a list of things they did right 
            and wrong. Ideally, they get a chance to improve their work, 
            and submit again.</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Timing</h2>
					<p>Students work through courses at their own pace, or at a 
            pace set by the professor.</p>
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
					<p>Students who fall are reminded where 
            they should be.</p>
				</section>

				<section class='smaller-text'>
					<h2>Summary: four roles</h2>
          <p><span class='highlight'>Authors</span> make good Cycos.</p>
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
					<p><span class='highlight'>Students</span> run through Cycos, 
            submitting work online.</p>
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
					<p><span class='highlight'>Graders</span> assess their work,

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

        <section>
					<h2></h2>
          <p class="highlight">To use Cyco, universities don't need to change
            <em>anything</em> about the way they operate.</p>
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
					<p>Semesters, classes, sections, credit hours, registration,
          schedules, grades... all stay the same.</p>
